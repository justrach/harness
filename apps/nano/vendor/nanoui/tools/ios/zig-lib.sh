# Zig 0.17.0 can't build any program for iOS as it ships: its std says iOS
# can replace its process image (std.process.can_replace), so every
# program's std.Io pulls in posix_spawn's /dev/null handling, which std
# leaves out on iOS ("no field named 'fd' in struct ... NullFile").
#
# This makes Zig's lib folder again, out of links to the real one, with
# that one line fixed, and prints the flag that uses it, which goes first:
#
#   zig build $(sh tools/ios/zig-lib.sh) -Dtarget=aarch64-ios-simulator
#
# A Zig whose std is fixed needs nothing: then it prints nothing.
